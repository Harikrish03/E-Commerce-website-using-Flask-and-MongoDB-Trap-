  "product_info": "A Pocket PC is a handheld computer, which features many of the same capabilities as a modern PC. These handy little devices allow individuals to retrieve and store e-mail messages, create a contact file, coordinate appointments, surf the internet, exchange text messages and more. Every product that is labeled as a Pocket PC must be accompanied with specific software to operate the unit and must feature a touchscreen and touchpad.As is the case with any new technology product, the cost of a Pocket PC was substantial during it’s early release. For approximately $700.00, consumers could purchase one of top-of-the-line Pocket PCs in 2003. These days, customers are finding that prices have become much more reasonable now that the newness is wearing off. For approximately $350.00, a new Pocket PC can now be purchased.",
